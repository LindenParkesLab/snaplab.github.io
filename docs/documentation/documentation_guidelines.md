All SNaP Lab members are expected to document their projects on this wiki. This tutorial is designed to get you started editing this site and contributing to its contents.

# Getting Started

## Github

First, you will need a [GitHub account](https://github.com) in order to be able to contribute; this website is automatically generated by a code repository on Github and is written primarily in markdown. If you haven't already, go setup a GitHub account and ask Linden to invite you to the lab's repository.

## Ruby and Jekyll

For long term editing, the best solution is to clone this repository onto your own computer and edit it locally. Using a combination of [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) and [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), you can compile a local version of this site that will allow you to preview your edits quickly before they go live. Once you're satisfied with your contributions, you will then submit a Pull Request on Github that merges your edits into the main repository. From there, your edits will be automagically incorporated into the online version of the site.

### Ruby

First, install `ruby` on your local machine (see [here](https://mac.install.guide/ruby/13) for longer instructions). If you're on Mac or Linux, the best way to do this is to use [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/). Once you have Homebrew installed, you will access to the command `brew` in your terminal. Next, use `brew` to install `ruby`, like so:

```shell
$ brew install ruby
```

Note, your computer might already have a system version of `ruby` installed (e.g., Mac OS does). This isn't going to work for us. Ignore it. To ensure your newly installed version of `ruby` is ready to use, you will also need to edit your terminal profile. If you're using a Mac with the newfangled Apple Silicon chips, do the following:

```shell
$ open -e ~/.zshrc
```

In the file that subsequently opens in TextEdit, add the following lines, then save and quit:

```
if [ -d "/opt/homebrew/opt/ruby/bin" ]; then
  export PATH=/opt/homebrew/opt/ruby/bin:$PATH
  export PATH=`gem environment gemdir`/bin:$PATH
fi
```

Now quit and reopen your terminal and you should be ready to use `ruby`, but let's verify:

```shell
$ which ruby
```

This should return something like:

```
/opt/homebrew/opt/ruby/bin/ruby
```

If you get something like the above, you're good to go!

### Jekyll

Using `ruby`, install `jekyll`. Note, the command line function that invokes `ruby` is `gem`:

```shell
$ gem install --user-install bundler jekyll
```

## Clone the repo

Now that you've got the tools you need, let's clone the GitHub repo for this site!

```shell
$ cd ~/
$ git clone https://github.com/LindenParkesLab/snaplab.github.io.git
```

If you look in the repo directory, you will see a folder called `docs/`. This is where you will add to and edit the content of this wiki. Next, change into the repo directory and build the site. Basically, you're going to tell `jekyll` to take all of the contents in the current directory and spin them up into a webpage, and `ruby` will serve it to on your local machine:

```shell
$ cd ~/snaplab.github.io
$ bundle exec jekyll serve
```

If you see something that ends with this:

```
Server address: http://127.0.0.1:4000/snaplab.github.io/
Server running... press ctrl-c to stop.
```

You're in business! Just visit [http://127.0.0.1:4000/snaplab.github.io/](http://127.0.0.1:4000/snaplab.github.io/) in your web browser to view the local version of the SNaP Lab wiki!

You can now edit files locally in `docs/`, and whenever you save a file, the local web page will update automatically to reflect those changes!
When you're done, hit CTRL-C in your terminal to stop serving the site, and then submit your Pull Request to put them on the internet.

Look at you go.
