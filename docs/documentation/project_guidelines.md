A core component of a project at the SNaP Lab is its documentation. Each lab member is expected to host and document a project's code on the lab's GitHub repository and use that same repository to create a summary webpage, using GitHub Pages.

# Managing a project on GitHub

## Create a GitHub repo for your project

If you haven't done so already, start by creating a repository on the lab's GitHub for your project. If you need a folder structure template, see [`SNaPLab/project_template`](https://github.com/LindenParkesLab/project_template/tree/main).

## Switch to the `gh-pages` branch

Once the project has been published in a peer-reviewed journal, create a new branch in your project's GitHub repo called `gh-pages`. Note, this branch is created on *your* project's GitHub repo, not here on the wiki's repo. The simplest way to do this is via the GitHub website.

First, click on the branch dropdown menu and then `View all branches`:

<img src="/assets/images/main_view_all_branches.png" alt="" width="250">

Second, click `New branch` in the top right (the big green button). In the box that pops up, create a new branch call `gh-pages` sourced from `main`:

<img src="/assets/images/create_gh_pages.png" alt="" width="300">

Third, on your local machine, you'll need to pull the new `gh-pages` branch down from the remote source (e.g., via `Fetch origin` if you're using GitHub Desktop).

Finally, switch to your `gh-pages` branch. If you're using GitHub Desktop, you can do this from a dropdown box in the app. If you're using the terminal, just type `git checkout gh-pages`.

## Adding content to `gh-pages`

Once you're working in the `gh-pages` branch on your local machine, you will need to add the following files to your project's repo:

1. `_config.yml`
2. `my_graphic.png`
3. `index.md`

In `_config.yml`, paste the following content:

```
title: <br> 
logo: ./my_graphic.png
theme: jekyll-theme-minimal
```

For `index.md`, see [here](https://github.com/LindenParkesLab/nctpy/blob/gh-pages/index.md) for an example. Just copy the subheadings and fill out the content as it pertains to your project. Please ask Linden if you're confused.

## Publish your page!

Once you've added/modified the above files, pushed your repository's `gh-pages` branch to GitHub. Then, after a little wait, your project's documentation should build on GitHub Pages and should be available at **https://lindenparkeslab.github.io/YOUR_PROJECT_NAME**!

To view an example, see [https://lindenparkeslab.github.io/nctpy/](https://lindenparkeslab.github.io/nctpy/).

Don't forget to change back to your `main` branch (`git checkout main`).

> Important
>
> Remember not to mix up your `main` and `gh-pages` branches!
> You don't want to add code to `gh-pages` or unnecessary documentation to `main`.

If you ever want to see what's going on with your GitHub Pages branch on GitHub,
you can simply go to **https://lindenparkeslab.github.io/YOUR_PROJECT_NAME/branches** to look at your `main` and `gh-pages` branch.

Look at you go.
