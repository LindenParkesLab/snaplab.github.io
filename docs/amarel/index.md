At the SNaP Lab, we use the Amarel cluster. Amarel is managed by the Rutgers [Office of Advanced Research Computing (OARC)](https://oarc.rutgers.edu/). OARC has its own wiki, which you can find [here](https://sites.google.com/view/cluster-user-guide). Please follow their instructions to create an account.

On the SNaP Lab wiki, you will find extra tutorials and tools designed to make your life a little easier.
