# Using Concur

All reimbursements at the SNaP Lab are processed via **Concur**. You can access **Concur** through your **myRutgers Portal**. First, navigate to the `Apps` page (which can be found in the red side bar on the left hand side of the page) and open `Concur Travel & Expense`. Note, if you're having trouble finding **Concur**, use the `Search Apps` bar in the top right corner. Also, you can save the **Concur** app as a favorite for easier access later.

You should be taken to a page that looks like this:

## Submitting a expense report to claim reimbursement

Unlike travel, non-travel related reimbursements do not need prior approval. From the Concur home page click on the big blue `Create` button and then click `Start a report`. This will open a new report with a blank header. In the `Report Type` dropdown box, select `*Rutgers Non-Travel Expense Report`. Then, fill out the remainder of the header by giving the report a name and using the appropriate funding information provided by Linden. Below is an example:

{: .note-title }
> Note
>
> Please contact Linden for the appropriate `Project.Task`, `Activity`, `Unit.Division.Organization (UDO)`, `Location`, `Fund`, and `Business Line` codes. These will typically be Linden's startup funds, but may change. It's important to verify with Linden **before** submitting.

Click `Create Report` and you will be taken to your empty report. Now you can add the expenses that you want reimbursed. First, click `+ Add Expense` and then select `Manually Create Expense`. Now search for the expense type you want to have reimbursed. For example, if you search for and select `Conference/Seminar Registration Fees`, you will get the following window:

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/concur_travel/new_expense.png" alt="" width="800">

You will need to fill out all the boxes marked with a red asterisk. Most importantly, you will also need to upload a receipt (click `Add Receipt` button) and add `Attendees`. For the latter, you just need to add yourself as an attendee. Finally, for `Conference/Seminar Registration Fees` in particular, you will need to also upload some evidence of conference attendance (e.g., a conference program booklet or attendance certificate). See below for an example of a completed `Conference/Seminar Registration Fees` expense:

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/concur_travel/completed_expense.png" alt="" width="800">

Once completed, click `Save Expense` in the bottom left and you will be brought back to the report page. From there you can add more expenses.

Note, you may encounter errors along the way. If you have any questions, please ask Linden.
