# Using Concur

All travel and reimbursements at the SNaP Lab are processed via **Concur**. This is a two-step process that involves (i) submitting a request for travel authorization *before* you travel and (ii) submitting an expense report after you return from travel. Note, you cannot submit a reimbursement request without an approved travel request.

You can access **Concur** through your **myRutgers Portal**. First, navigate to the Apps page and open `Concur Travel & Expense` (note, you can save this as a favorite for easier access later). You should be taken to a page that looks like this:

# Submitting a travel authorization request before you travel

Before you travel, you need to submit a travel authorization request. To do so, navigate your cursor to the `Requests` box on your **Concur** home page and click the + button (red arrow):

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/concur_travel/concur_home_arrow.png" alt="" width="800">

This should bring up a window that looks like this:

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/concur_travel/create_request.png" alt="" width="800">

This window has five sections in it separated by horizontal gray lines (see red numbers). You only need to *modify sections 2 and 3*. Here is an example of a modified section 2:

For section 3, you will need to provide a `Project.Task` number. This will vary between travel requests. Please contract Linden for an appropriate value. Note, do not modify any of the codes in sections 4 and 5. Once you've completed sections 2 and 3, click `Create Request` and you will be taken to a blank request page. On this page, there are two buttons to focus on: `Manage Travel Allowance` and `+ Add`:

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/concur_travel/blank_request.png" alt="" width="800">

Let's start with `Manage Travel Allowance`. Clicking this button will open a page that allows you fill out information needed to optinally add per-diem expenses to your trip. Note, information does not need to be exact at this stage. Simply fill out your start and end locations and approximate times (e.g., 9am to 5pm) and click `Next`. On the subsequent page, you will be given an option to add days that you want to request reimbursements for. The rates are determined by Rutgers. Note, the tick boxes code for days you want to *exclude* from your per-diem request, not the days you want to *include* in your request. If you want to claim the full per-diem amount, leave all boxes blank. Click `Finish`.

Next, let's look at the `+ Add` button. Clicking this button will allow you to add estimates for Airfare, Accomodation, and Conference Registration Fees. In each of these cases, the estimates do not need to be exact. Just enter in your best attempt at an accurate estimate and click `Save`.

Once you've filled out your request, click the blue `Submit Request` in the top right corner. Once submitted, the request will be routed to the Department of Psychiatry for approval. Once it has been approved, you can book your travel.

# Booking travel via Concur directly

While you can book certain things yourself and get reimbursed (see below), it is preferable to book as much of your trip as possible directly through **Concur**. This minimizes your out-of-pocket expenses. Also, Rutgers *requires* that we book flights via **Concur**; *you cannot book these yourself*. Flights, cars, hotels, and Amtrak trains can all be booked using **Concur**. All of these can be searched and booked using the widget on the left hand side of the homepage:

# Submitting a expense report after you travel

Once you get back from your trip---and assuming you have an approved travel authorization request---you're ready to submit the final expense report. Note, this is where you will get your out-of-pocket expenses reimbursed. To start, navigate to your approved request that you submitted above. Once loaded, you should see that the blue button that used to say `Submit Request` now says `Create Expense Report`: 

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/concur_travel/approved_request.png" alt="" width="800">

Click `Create Expense Report` and you will be taken to a page that looks just like the travel authorization request. Note, if everything worked, you should see your approved request referenced in the top left corner of your newly created expense report. The process is similar to the above, but now with more detail. Use the `Travel Allowance` and the `+ Add Expense` button to add your per-diem and your final expenses. The key difference between the travel request and expense report is that the latter requires receipts for all expenses (except for per-diem). 

Let's walk through an example of adding an expense. First, click `+ Add Expense` and then toggle to the `New Expense` tab in the subsequent window. From that window, select `Conference/Seminar Registration Fees`. This will bring up the following window:

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/concur_travel/new_expense.png" alt="" width="800">

You will need to fill out all the boxes marked with a red asterisk. Most importantly, you will also need to upload a receipt (click `Add Receipt` button) and add `Attendees`. For the latter, you just need to add yourself as an attendee. Finally, for `Conference/Seminar Registration Fees` in particular, you will need to also upload some evidence of conference attendance (e.g., a conference program booklet or attendence certificate). See below for an example of a completed `Conference/Seminar Registration Fees` expense:

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/concur_travel/completed_expense.png" alt="" width="800">

Once completed, click `Save Expense` in the bottom left and you will be brought back to the report page. From there you can more expenses.

Once completed, click `Submit Report`. You may encounter errors along the way. If you have any questions, please ask Linden.
